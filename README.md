## Project description:
 We want to create a trivia game that is based on a board game called Geni.
 The game is planned to include following features:
 * Have up to 4 players/NPC:s that play simultaneously. 
 * Questions based on different categories.
 * A graphical visualization of the board game.
 * Be able to answer questions by choosing between different checkboxes and by writing. 
 
 Features will be added and/or deleted depending on how the project is going. 
 
 We are going to begin testing our code with unit tests while we are developing our game. 
 Later on we may find other ways to test the game. 
 
 #### How to play

The player plays the game by clicking the button to roll a dice. The player then moves, and is to answer questions, mostly related to
programming. 

If the player answers a question correctly, her or she is awarded points.
The player who first reaches the required amount of points to win, wins the game.

The player plays against 3 computer players, or NPCs. These players will 
also attempt to win. If none of these players gets high enough score once all the questions are 
answered, no one is declared the winner. 

The questions are structurized into six various categories, with five of them being questions
related to the Computer Scientist programme at KTH. The sixth category will involve general questions
which can be everything, as an example one such question is "How many times did Arnold win Mr Olympia?".
