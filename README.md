## Project description:
 We want to create a trivia game that is based on a board game called Geni.
 The game is planned to include following features:
 * Have up to 4 players/NPC:s that play simultaneously. 
 * Questions based on different categories.
 * A graphical visualization of the board game.
 * Be able to answer questions by choosing between different checkboxes and by writing. 
 
 Features will be added and/or deleted depending on how the project is going. 
 
 We are going to begin testing our code with unit tests while we are developing our game. 
 Later on we may find other ways to test the game.
